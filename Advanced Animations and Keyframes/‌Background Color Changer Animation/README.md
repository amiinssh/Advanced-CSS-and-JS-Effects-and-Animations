# Minimalistic Centered Animation

This project creates a full-screen centered animation with a text element that adjusts based on a changing background color.

## Features

- **Full-Screen Layout**: The content spans the entire viewport.
- **Centered Text**: The main text (`h1`) is centered horizontally and vertically.
- **Background Color Animation**: Smooth background color transitions with multiple color stages.
- **Responsive Font**: Clean, sans-serif font for a minimalistic style.

## Code Structure

- **`body`**:
  - Fills the viewport height (`100vh`) with centered content.
  - Animates background colors every 10 seconds.
  
- **`h1`**:
  - Large, centered text that automatically capitalizes.
  - Styled in white for high contrast.

- **`@keyframes bg-change`**:
  - Defines a color-changing animation with several stages:
    - Dark grey → Blue → Tomato → Yellow → Green → Pink
